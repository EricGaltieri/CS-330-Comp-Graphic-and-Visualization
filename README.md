    How do I approach designing software?
-What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I made sure to lay out plans and review my project repeatedly to make sure the environment was forming the way I wanted. I also learned that laying out code in blocks allowed me to take time to review and understand how the systems work together to form the foundation of what I was making. 

-What design process did you follow for your project work?
I would create a sketch of what I wanted then take time to understand what shaped would create the model, once complete I would take time to add models together piece by piece to get my desired result. 

-How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I made sure to add comments for myself in the future to understand what I was working on, what I’ve already tried and what I can do in the future to make it easier on myself when solving the same issue. 

        
    How do I approach developing programs?
-What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The 3d required me to research and read the resources give to us many time for me to gather what was going on and how to use it for the scene I was creating, so research and resources gathering was critical here. 

-How did iteration factor into your development?
I would constantly run and rerun my code to see the small changes that where made, and I would jot these down to make sure I understood what happened at every point 

-How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My time management needs work when creating and making these projects, as the projects have become more difficult and more time consuming I have had to play catch up a lot more as I tried initially to do my projects and class work on my weekends, when regarding these type of projects I see that is not the best strategy 

        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I quite like learning about the 3d graphics and design portion of the class work and I feel like this will be something I use on my own to create more complex worlds and structures.
        
-How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I plan on using these in thr future if possible on any projects I work
